        <p>Kyoung Oh started his baseball career at Playboys, a baseball club in SNU.
        <br>Although there are many other club, he chosse Playboys. Why?</p>
        First, Playboys consists of students of material science, Kyoung Oh's majore.
        <br>Second, as you saw before, he is a big dick guy. He wanted many hot girls.</li>
      <p><li><font size = "5">SNU baseball team</font></p>
        Some senior members of playboys (Park,Ko,Han) recommended him to join the SNU baseball team with them.
        <br>So he joined there at 08.03.2013, and it was the birthday of the coach, Kwanghwan Lee.
         Also it was the birth of all time legend in SNU.</li>
        <p><li><font size = "5">Experience and Carrer in SNU baseball team</font> </p>
        He always did his best for team. For example, in a winter 2013-2014, SNU baseball team had to move the dirt-mountain required to maintain ground.
        <br>All players had been tired doing 'Sap-Jeel" a thousands of time. Someone cried, the other gave up, another wanted to exit the team.
        <br>By the time, Kyoung Oh stood up and did Sap-Jeel very fast. His speed was so intensive that it really lookeed like Digda.
        <br>And before the crying man stop his crying, Kyoung Oh finished all stuffs. And he save the team.
        <p> There were so many legendary things that I couldn't all things because I have no space.</p>
        <p>Just remember this. He was the best hitter (4th, cleanup) at SNU in his last season.
        <br> One of the game, he had a chance to score. Before that game, he made many hits so it was his peak season.
        <br> But coach ordered him to make a bunt. All team member was supprised and embarassed.
        <br> They expected him to make a hit. But Kyoung Oh nodded his head camly. Everybody shut their mouse,
        <br> and he made perpect bunt. He sacrificed himself for team. Since that, he became a symbor of SNU. </p></li>

        <br>* He has no record in club, because he betrayed Playboys which had grown him for 5years. He'll start new career at 이모작스
